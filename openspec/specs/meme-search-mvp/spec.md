# Meme Search MVP

## Context
- Scope: local single-machine MVP for meme semantic search.
- Primary language: Traditional Chinese metadata and query analysis.
- Out of scope: auth, multi-user sync, cloud deployment, GIF/video ingestion, meme generation.

## Requirements

### REQ-MVP-001 OpenSpec Bootstrap
- The repository MUST keep the MVP requirements under `openspec/specs/meme-search-mvp/spec.md`.
- All production modules MUST implement behavior described in this spec.

### REQ-MVP-002 Unified Meme Metadata
- Every indexed image MUST resolve into one canonical metadata schema containing:
  - `image_id`
  - `file_path`
  - `has_text`
  - `ocr_text`
  - `ocr_status`
  - `ocr_confidence`
  - `ocr_lines`
  - `template_name`
  - `template_canonical_id`
  - `template_aliases`
  - `template_family`
  - `scene_description`
  - `meme_usage`
  - `visual_description`
  - `aesthetic_tags`
  - `usage_scenario`
  - `emotion_tags`
  - `intent_tags`
  - `style_tags`
  - `embedding_text`
- `visual_description` MUST contain an AI-generated aesthetic description of the image's visual composition, expressions, and overall impression, written in Traditional Chinese.
- `aesthetic_tags` MUST contain short tags describing visual style characteristics (for example `對比構圖`, `表情誇張`, `二段式`).
- `usage_scenario` MUST describe the conversational scenario where this meme is most effective, written in Traditional Chinese.
- `embedding_text` MUST concatenate, in order: template information, visual description, scene description, common meme usage, usage scenario, OCR text, emotion tags, intent tags, style tags, aesthetic tags.
- Template normalization MUST map visually similar aliases (for example `AnimeReaction` and `anime_reaction`) to the same `template_canonical_id`.

### REQ-MVP-003 Incremental Indexing Pipeline
- The system MUST provide a CLI command `index build --source <dir> [--reindex]`.
- The indexer MUST recursively scan `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`.
- The indexer MUST compute SHA-256 per file and skip already indexed files unless `--reindex` is used.
- Incremental skip decisions MUST treat an image as already indexed only when its canonical metadata and all required vector documents for the current embedding index version are present.
- Images left in a partial or failed indexing state, or indexed under an outdated embedding index version, MUST be retried on the next non-`--reindex` build instead of being skipped.
- The metadata provider MUST perform OCR, aesthetic analysis, and metadata extraction in a single Vision LLM call, eliminating the need for a separate OCR step during indexing.
- When a dedicated OCR provider is configured (for example PaddleOCR), the indexer MAY run it before metadata analysis and pass the OCR text as a hint; the metadata provider MUST still accept and process images without a prior OCR result.
- OCR failures MUST degrade to empty text, set `ocr_status` to `failed`, and continue processing.
- OCR empty-but-successful runs MUST set `ocr_status` to `empty`.
- OCR degradation events MUST be recorded in `index_runs` without aborting the batch.
- Metadata or embedding failures for one image MUST be recorded in `index_runs` and MUST NOT abort the batch.
- Canonical metadata MUST be stored in SQLite and vector documents MUST be stored in Chroma-compatible storage.
- ChromaDB HNSW index read failures (corrupted or missing index files) MUST be caught at the vector store layer and MUST return empty results with a logged warning instead of propagating an unhandled exception.
- Vector retrieval route failures during search MUST degrade gracefully per-route (returning zero candidates for the failed route) and MUST be recorded in `search_trace.degraded_routes` instead of aborting the entire search request.
- The indexer MUST store per-channel vector documents with an index schema/version boundary derived from provider/model/dimension/channel so incompatible embedding versions do not share the same vector collection or query surface.
- The indexer MUST maintain a keyword-searchable representation of template aliases, OCR text, and retrieval tags for lexical retrieval.

### REQ-MVP-004 Query Understanding and Vector Retrieval
- The system MUST expose `POST /api/v1/search`.
- Search input MUST support an optional user-provided preferred meme tone hint.
- Search input MUST support text-only, image-only, and mixed text+image queries.
- When an image query is provided, the system MUST analyze the query image through the metadata provider and convert it into retrieval inputs without requiring the image to be pre-indexed first.
- Search input MUST be analyzed into structured query fields: situation, emotion, tone, reply intent, query terms, template hints, retrieval weights, and preferred meme tone.
- For image queries, structured query analysis MUST incorporate image-derived cues including OCR text, template hints, scene description, meme usage, and visual-description signals.
- Search MUST support two search modes via a `mode` field (`semantic` | `reply`, default `reply`):
  - **semantic**: finds memes whose overall meaning is close to the query.
  - **reply**: finds memes suitable as a witty reply to the query; OCR text weight is dominant.
- The indexer MUST produce at least two vector channels per meme:
  - A **semantic** channel built from the full `embedding_text` (template, scene, usage, OCR, tags).
  - A **reply_text** channel built from OCR-focused text that emphasizes the meme's actual wording and reply tone.
- Search MUST use multi-route retrieval:
  - vector retrieval over the semantic channel
  - vector retrieval over the reply_text channel when in `reply` mode
  - keyword/template retrieval over OCR text, template aliases, and retrieval tags
- In `reply` mode, OCR keyword/template retrieval and the `reply_text` channel MUST be the primary routes; the semantic channel MUST be treated as a supplemental backfill route only.
- Search MUST merge, deduplicate, and score candidates from all enabled retrieval routes before reranking.
- Search MUST generate route-specific retrieval inputs from query analysis rather than relying on a single query embedding string as the only retrieval artifact.
- When both text and image query inputs are present, the retrieval inputs MUST merge user text intent with image-derived metadata instead of dropping either source.
- Search SHOULD batch query embedding generation across active retrieval routes within a single search request when those routes use the same embedding provider.
- Search SHOULD reuse in-memory cached query analysis, query embeddings, and rerank outputs for repeated identical searches within the same process when the provider configuration has not changed.
- Search output MUST include `query_analysis`, `results`, `provider_trace`, and a minimal `search_trace` showing candidate-source and degradation information.

### REQ-MVP-005 LLM Reranking and Reasoning
- Retrieved candidates MUST be reranked before final output when a reranker is available.
- Retrieved candidates MUST first receive deterministic feature scores before LLM reranking, including lexical OCR overlap, template matches, tag overlaps, vector scores, and reply-mode OCR gating.
- The deterministic feature scoring profile SHOULD be serializable to JSON so it can be tuned offline and reused at runtime.
- Reranking MUST respect the search mode:
  - **reply** mode: OCR text (`ocr_text`) and reply fitness are the primary ranking signals; candidates with `ocr_status == success` but whose OCR text has low lexical overlap with the query (below `ocr_mismatch_threshold`) MUST have their deterministic score capped at `ocr_mismatch_score_cap`; candidates without OCR text MAY compete freely based on visual expression relevance without a hard score cap.
  - **semantic** mode: overall semantic similarity, scene description, and tag overlap are the primary ranking criteria.
- In `reply` mode, scene/background description MUST be treated as a secondary tie-break signal rather than a primary ranking feature.
- If reranking fails, the system MUST fall back to deterministic candidate ranking and return a non-empty fallback reason for every result.
- Final results MUST include `image_id`, `image_url`, `reason`, `score`, `template_name`, `emotion_tags`, `intent_tags`, and route/debug metadata sufficient to explain degraded ranking.

### REQ-MVP-006 FastAPI Contract
- The API MUST expose `GET /api/v1/health`.
- The API MUST expose an image asset endpoint addressable by `image_id`.
- `POST /api/v1/search` MUST accept JSON search requests containing text input, base64-encoded image input, or both.
- `POST /api/v1/search` MUST reject requests that provide neither text nor image input.
- The API MUST not require Streamlit to access SQLite directly.

### REQ-MVP-007 Streamlit Unified Frontend
- The repository MUST include a multi-page Streamlit app as the primary user interface.
- The app MUST operate in Direct Mode, calling Python services directly without requiring a separate HTTP API server.
- The app MUST be launchable with a single command: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
- The app MUST include the following pages:
  - **Dashboard** (`streamlit_app.py`): system status overview showing current provider, vector backend, indexed meme count, and a health check.
  - **Settings** (`pages/1_⚙️_Settings.py`): provider selection (openai / lmstudio / mock), API key input, base URL, model configuration, vector backend, OCR backend, Telegram chat enable toggle, Telegram bot token input, and a persisted default meme folder path. Settings MUST be persisted to a TOML file (`data/memetalk_config.toml`).
  - **Index** (`pages/2_📦_Index.py`): meme folder path input seeded from the saved default meme folder, optional force-reindex toggle, progress display, and result summary (processed / indexed / skipped / failed counts with error details).
  - **Search** (`pages/3_🔍_Search.py`): search mode selector (適合回覆 / 契合語意), natural-language query input, optional query image uploader with preview, query analysis display, top-N result cards with images loaded from local file paths, recommended reason text, and visible emotion and intent tags.
- The Search page MUST include an optional input for preferred meme tone (for example 嘴砲, 冷淡, 可憐, 陰陽怪氣) and pass that preference into query analysis and reranking.
- The Search page MUST provide sidebar controls that let users adjust at runtime: display result count (`top_n`), rerank pool size, and initial retrieval count (`candidate_k`). Default values MUST come from the persisted configuration.
- The Search page MUST allow users to persist the current sidebar search parameter values (`top_n`, rerank pool size, `candidate_k`) back to `data/memetalk_config.toml` as the next-launch defaults without clearing unrelated stored fields.
- The Search page MUST allow searches to run when only a query image is provided, and MUST show a validation error only when both text and image inputs are absent.
- Settings MUST support a priority chain: environment variables > TOML config file > pydantic defaults.
- Settings persistence MUST merge submitted values with the existing persisted settings and MUST NOT clear unrelated stored fields such as `meme_folder` during a partial update.
- The Index page MUST treat its meme folder input as a per-run override only; editing that field in the page MUST NOT automatically rewrite the saved default meme folder path.
- The Streamlit app MUST apply a consistent visual shell across Dashboard, Settings, Index, and Search, including shared page headers, section hierarchy, and readable status presentation on both desktop and narrow layouts.
- The shared visual shell MUST support both Streamlit light and dark themes without per-page overrides, preserving readable contrast for backgrounds, cards, metrics, notices, buttons, form inputs, and expanders in both modes.
- The app MUST NOT require manual environment variable configuration or a `secrets.toml` file to start.

### REQ-MVP-008 Provider Abstraction
- The system MUST define replaceable provider interfaces for:
  - OCR via `extract_text` (optional; may be integrated into the metadata provider)
  - metadata analysis via `analyze_image(image_path, ocr_hint=None)` which MUST return unified metadata including OCR fields, visual description, aesthetic tags, usage scenario, and all traditional metadata fields
  - embeddings via `embed_texts`
- query analysis via `analyze_query(query, mode, preferred_tone=None)`
- reranking via `rerank(query, query_analysis, candidates, top_n, mode)`
- Query-image search flows MUST reuse the metadata provider plus embedding provider path and MUST NOT require a separate provider interface only for uploaded query images.
- OpenAI MUST be the default cloud provider configuration.
- The OpenAI-backed provider path MUST support OpenAI-compatible chat, vision, and embedding endpoints through configurable base URL and model settings.
- The system MUST support the following provider backends: `openai`, `lmstudio`, `ollama`, `llama_cpp`, `gemini`, `claude`, `mock`, `local`.
- Ollama, llama.cpp, and Gemini backends MUST reuse the OpenAI-compatible provider path with appropriate default base URLs and model mappings:
  - Ollama: default base URL `http://localhost:11434/v1`, default models `llama3` (chat), `llava` (vision), `nomic-embed-text` (embedding).
  - llama.cpp: default base URL `http://localhost:8080/v1`, model determined by server-loaded model.
  - Gemini: OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`, default models `gemini-2.0-flash` (chat/vision), `text-embedding-004` (embedding).
- The Claude backend MUST use the Anthropic SDK for chat, vision, query analysis, and reranking; embedding MUST be delegated to a configurable secondary provider (`openai` or `gemini`) since Anthropic does not offer an embedding API.
- The repository MUST provide a documented local provider configuration for LM Studio without changing application code.
- The repository MUST pin and document a known-good PaddleOCR runtime for Windows CPU environments; the validated MVP combination is `paddleocr==2.10.0` with `paddlepaddle==3.1.1`.
- OpenAI-compatible vision requests used by indexing and query-image search MUST locally normalize supported images into sanitized JPEG or PNG data URLs before upload, including EXIF orientation correction and incompatible color-mode cleanup, instead of forwarding original file bytes unchanged.
- OpenAI-compatible local provider failures MUST surface actionable guidance when required chat, vision, or embedding models are not available.
- OpenAI-compatible local provider image-processing failures MUST surface actionable guidance that the active model may not actually support image input even if the configured vision model id is set.
- PaddleOCR runtime failures caused by known Windows CPU inference incompatibilities MUST surface actionable guidance instead of only returning the raw Paddle error.
- OpenAI-compatible structured outputs MUST retry or repair recoverable malformed JSON before failing a request.
- OpenAI-compatible rerank structured outputs MUST accept a recoverable top-level JSON array response and normalize it into the expected `results` object shape before failing the request.
- Anthropic-backed structured outputs MUST retry or repair recoverable malformed JSON before failing a request.
- Anthropic-backed rerank structured outputs MUST accept a recoverable top-level JSON array response and normalize it into the expected `results` object shape before failing the request.
- The codebase MUST include a local/mock-friendly provider path so tests can run without external services.

### REQ-MVP-009 Evaluation Pipeline
- The repository MUST provide an offline evaluation pipeline over a fixed query set with positives and hard negatives.
- The evaluation pipeline MUST report at least `precision_at_k` and `mrr`.
- The evaluation fixtures MUST cover reply queries, semantic queries, template-driven queries, OCR phrase queries, and reaction/no-text queries.
- The repository MUST provide an offline tuning command `eval tune --cases <file> [--output <file>]` that optimizes the deterministic scoring profile against the evaluation cases and writes the tuned profile to JSON.
- The tuning objective MUST penalize hard-negative hits in addition to improving retrieval relevance metrics.

### REQ-MVP-010 Telegram Chat Integration
- The repository MUST include an optional Telegram long-polling bot integration inside the same codebase.
- Telegram bot runtime settings MUST be configurable through the same `AppSettings` source chain used by the UI (`environment variables > TOML config file > pydantic defaults`), including:
  - `telegram_enabled`
  - `telegram_bot_token`
- The Settings page MUST allow users to persist `telegram_enabled` and `telegram_bot_token` without clearing unrelated settings.
- The CLI MUST expose a Telegram run command that starts the bot only when Telegram chat is enabled and a bot token is configured.
- `launch.bat` MUST start the Telegram bot in a separate process when Telegram chat is enabled and a bot token is configured, without blocking the Streamlit UI startup flow.
- The Telegram bot MUST support `/start`, `/help`, and free-form text messages.
- For free-form text messages, the bot MUST decide between `text`, `meme`, and `both`.
- The bot MUST reuse the active MemeTalk provider/backend settings for routing decisions instead of introducing a second unrelated model configuration surface.
- The bot MUST execute meme retrieval through the in-repo application services directly and MUST NOT require a separately running FastAPI server when used with the Streamlit app's Direct Mode.
- The Telegram bot MUST keep a bounded short-term conversation history per chat in memory and pass that recent context into subsequent routing decisions.
- The Telegram short-term conversation history MAY reset when the bot process restarts.
- The Telegram bot MUST normalize locally loaded meme image bytes into a Telegram-compatible upload payload before calling Telegram when the original file format or mode is not reliably accepted as a photo upload.
- When meme retrieval succeeds, the Telegram bot MUST send only the meme image without caption text and MUST suppress any additional follow-up text for that reply, even when routing decided `both`.
- If routing fails, the bot MUST send a plain-text apology response.
- If meme retrieval fails or returns no result, the bot MUST fall back to plain-text output.
- If a meme image cannot be read, the bot MUST fall back to a plain-text explanation derived from the selected result.

### REQ-MVP-011 Social Content Knowledge Base
- The repository MUST include a social content knowledge base module (`social_kb`) that allows users to save, classify, and analyse content collected from social platforms (Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, YouTube, etc.).
- The knowledge base MUST store content items in the same SQLite database used by the meme system, in a dedicated `social_content` table, without schema interference with existing meme tables.
- Each content item MUST include: `item_id`, `url`, `title`, `raw_content`, `source_platform`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and a nested `ContentAnalysis` record.
- `ContentAnalysis` MUST include: `category` (one of 科技/AI, 商業/創業, 投資/理財, 健康/養生, 教育/學習, 行銷/自媒體, 娛樂/文化, 時事/社會, 其他), `tags`, `summary`, `key_points`, `trend_relevance`, and a `MonetizationScore`.
- `MonetizationScore` MUST include four per-dimension scores (0–10): `social_score` (社群流量變現), `knowledge_score` (知識產品), `affiliate_score` (聯盟行銷), `consulting_score` (接案顧問), plus an `overall_score`, `channels` list, `content_angles` list, and `reasoning`.
- The content extractor MUST fetch URLs asynchronously using an HTTP client, parse page title and body text using an HTML parser, cap extracted text at 8,000 characters, and automatically detect source platform from URL patterns.
- The AI analyser MUST support all provider backends defined in REQ-MVP-008 (`openai`, `lmstudio`, `ollama`, `llama_cpp`, `gemini`, `claude`, `mock`, `local`). When `provider_backend` is `mock`, the analyser MUST return a stub analysis without making any external API call.
- The knowledge base MUST support filtering by category, minimum overall_score, and keyword search across title, summary, and tags. Results MUST be sortable by `created_at` (newest first) or `overall_score` (highest first).
- The Streamlit app MUST include a fourth page (`pages/4_📚_知識庫.py`) providing:
  - **📚 知識庫 tab**: URL input to add new content (with async fetch + AI analysis), item cards with per-dimension score bars, checkbox-based multi-selection, and an article generation panel.
  - **📊 賽道分析 tab**: batch aggregation over the knowledge base to identify topic tracks by high-score count, with readiness levels (📌 / 🌱 / 🌿 / 🌳) and optional AI deep-dive per track.
- The article generator MUST accept 2 or more `ContentItem` records and a style selector (部落格/Medium, LinkedIn 長文, IG 懶人包, 新聞稿), synthesise them into a new original article with title, subtitle, intro, body sections, conclusion, hashtags, and format recommendations. The `mock` backend MUST return a deterministic stub article.
- The track analyser MUST aggregate the knowledge base by category using a single SQL GROUP BY query, compute per-category counts and score averages, and optionally call the AI provider to produce common themes, market opportunity, recommended products, and a three-step action plan per track.
- The Telegram bot MUST support three additional commands beyond REQ-MVP-010:
  - `/save <url>`: fetch the URL, run AI analysis, save to the knowledge base, and reply with a formatted summary including per-dimension score bars and top monetisation channels.
  - `/kb`: reply with total item count and category breakdown from the knowledge base.
  - `/find <query>`: search the knowledge base by keyword and return the top 5 results sorted by overall_score.
- All three Telegram knowledge base commands MUST be registered via a `register_kb_handlers()` function that initialises the repository and analyser and attaches them to the bot application's `bot_data`.

## Acceptance
- The project MUST include automated tests covering schema validation, embedding text composition, provider registry, OCR success/empty/failure branching, template normalization, multi-route retrieval, rerank fallback, index schema/version isolation, evaluation reporting, indexing, image-query search, API response shape, Telegram settings/runtime integration, and social knowledge base model/repository/extractor/analyser/generator/track-analyser behaviour with mock provider.
- A minimal dataset of static images MUST be indexable and searchable end-to-end without changing code.
